## Overview

### The challenge

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

- First build the mobile version of the application and then desktop version,finally implement the javascript logic.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive web design.
- Mobile-first workflow.
- Tailwind css.

### What I learned

- I has been a while since I said that I would be using tailwind css,however I have found it to be a useful tool indeed.I have also learnt that the for
  each loop js can return a value.

### Continued development

I will continue learning and developing javascript validation forms and make them to be more efficient and useful.

### Useful resources

- [Tools](Jonas.io/resources) - This helped me for color and web testing tools. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- [Tools](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1353684/detecting-an-invalid-date-date-instance-in-javascript) - This is stack overflow page which describes on cheking if a date is valid or not.
